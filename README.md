# SpringABC

## What it is:
A series of hierarchical templates for Spring Games:

- **A**(lmost Minimal) - Basically just empty directories and a working ModInfo.lua, EngineOptions.lua, ModOptions.lua, Gamedata/Resources.lua and base-content gadget handler inclusion.
- **B**(are Bones) - A + Gamedata/{ArmorDefs.lua, MoveDefs.lua, SideData.lua} skeletons with links to relevant wiki articles, as well as inclusion of base content unit_script.lua, game_spawn.lua and game_end.lua
- **C**(hili UI Framework) - B + Chili (2.1) & associated files to make it work

Most people will want to use B or C, A isn't much use to anyone.

## What it isn't:
- A replacement to SimpleTutorialGame (but perhaps to PTSnoop's EmptyMod, which was in turn based on the original A.sdd)
- A repository of example units and scripts, none are included whatsoever
